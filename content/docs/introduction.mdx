## !!steps The Control Hub

This diagram is like a map of your robot's entire nervous system. Right in the middle is the 
**Control Hub**—this is the "brain" of your robot where all of your code lives. 

To make a robot work, the brain needs to talk to three main things: its power, its muscles, and its senses. Here is how everything connects:

## !!steps The Power 
Your robot needs energy! The **Battery** plugs into the Control Hub through a **Switch**, which acts as a safety gate so you can quickly turn your robot on and off.

## !!steps The Muscle
**Motors:** The big cylinder parts (like the HD Hex Motor) are your heavy lifters for driving wheels. They use two wires: a thick "Power" wire to spin, and a smaller "Encoder" wire that acts like a pedometer to tell the brain exactly how many times the motor turned.

**Servos:** The small square box is a Servo. Think of this as a wrist. It doesn't spin fast, but it moves to exact angles to open and close claws.

## !!steps The Senses
This is how your robot feels and sees the world! 

**I2C Ports:** For smart sensors, like the **Color Sensor** (to see game pieces) and the **Distance Sensor** (to measure walls).

**Digital Ports:** For simple "Yes or No" sensors, like a **Touch Sensor** or **Magnetic Switch**.

**Analog Ports:** For reading ranges, like a **Potentiometer**, which acts like a volume dial to tell the brain what angle it is pointing at.
