## !!steps Open the Console

Make sure you are connected to your Control Hub's Wi-Fi (see the previous tutorial). Open a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) and type **192.168.43.1:8080** in the address bar, then press Enter.

This opens the **Robot Controller Console** — the home screen for programming your robot. You will see a menu bar at the top with options for **Blocks**, **OnBot Java**, and **Manage**.

**Note:** While connected to the Control Hub, your computer will not have internet access. That is normal!

## !!steps Pick a Programming Tool

You have two beginner-friendly options:

**Blocks (Recommended for Beginners)**
A drag-and-drop editor, similar to Scratch. You snap together code pieces like puzzle blocks. No typing needed! It even has a "Show Java" button so you can peek at the real code behind your blocks.

**OnBot Java**
A text-based editor for students who already know some Java. You type real code directly in the browser. It gives you more control but requires you to know Java basics.

For this tutorial, we will use **Blocks** — the easiest way to start.

Click the **Blocks** tab in the menu bar to open the Blocks programming page.

## !!steps What is an OpMode?

An **OpMode** is a program that controls your robot. Think of it as a recipe — a set of instructions your robot follows step by step.

There are two types:

**TeleOp** — You drive the robot with a gamepad controller, like a video game. The program reads your joystick and button inputs and moves the robot in real time.

**Autonomous** — The robot drives itself! The program runs for 30 seconds with no human input. This is used during the autonomous period of FTC matches.

## !!steps Create Your First OpMode

In the Blocks editor, click the **Create New OpMode** button.

You will be asked to:
1. **Name your OpMode** — Give it a simple name like `MyFirstProgram` (no spaces!)
2. **Choose a template** — Select **BasicOpMode**. This gives you the basic structure you need.
3. **Choose a type** — Pick **TeleOp** for now, since we want to test by hand.

Click **OK** and the editor will open with some starter code already in place.

## !!steps Understand the Code Structure

Your new OpMode has three important sections, marked by comments (gray text):

**Initialization** — Runs once when you press **Init** on the Driver Hub. This is where you set up your motors and servos to their starting positions.

**Wait for Start** — The program pauses here until you press the **Play** button on the Driver Hub.

**Main Loop** — Everything inside the `while (opModeIsActive)` loop runs over and over until you press **Stop**. This is where most of your code goes — reading sensors, moving motors, and checking the gamepad.

## !!steps Save and Run

When you are done editing, click **Save OpMode** in the top-left corner of the Blocks editor.

To run your program:
1. Open the **Driver Hub** (or Driver Station app on a phone)
2. Make sure it is paired to your Control Hub
3. Select your OpMode from the dropdown list
4. Press **Init** to initialize
5. Press the **Play** button to start

Press **Stop** at any time to end the program. Congrats — you just ran your first OpMode!
