## !!steps Open the Console

Make sure you are connected to your Control Hub's Wi-Fi (see the previous tutorial). Open a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) and type **192.168.43.1:8080** in the address bar, then press Enter.

This opens the **Robot Controller Console** — the home screen for programming your robot. You will see a menu bar at the top with options for **Blocks**, **OnBot Java**, and **Manage**.

**Note:** While connected to the Control Hub, your computer will not have internet access. That is normal!

## !!steps Open the Blocks Editor

Click the **Blocks** tab in the menu bar. You will see the **My OpModes** page — a list of all the programs saved on your robot.

This is your home base for creating, editing, and managing your robot programs. Each row is an OpMode (a program) that you or someone else has created.

## !!steps Create a New OpMode

Click the **Create New OpMode** button in the top-left corner. A dialog box will appear asking you to set up your new program.

You will see two fields:
- **OpMode Name** — where you type the name of your program
- **Sample** — a dropdown to pick a starter template

## !!steps Choose a Template

Click the **Sample** dropdown to see the available templates. Select **BasicOpMode** — this gives you the simplest starting structure with all the sections you need.

There are many other templates for more advanced programs, but BasicOpMode is the best place to start.

## !!steps Name Your OpMode

Type a name for your program in the **OpMode Name** field. For this tutorial, we will use `TwoMotorDrive` since we will be programming two motors.

Keep names simple — use letters and underscores only, no spaces. When you are ready, click **OK** to create the OpMode.

## !!steps Understand the Code Structure

The editor opens with your new OpMode. On the left you will see the **block categories** (Actuators, Sensors, Logic, etc.) and in the center is your **program workspace**.

Your new OpMode has three important sections:

**Initialization** — Runs once when you press **Init** on the Driver Hub. This is where you set up motors and servos.

**Wait for Start** — The program pauses here until you press the **Play** button.

**Main Loop** — Everything inside the `repeat while opModeIsActive` loop runs over and over until you press **Stop**. This is where most of your code goes.

On the right side, you can click **Show Java** to see the real Java code behind your blocks.
