Servos are like robot wrists — they do not spin fast like motors, but they move to exact positions. Perfect for opening claws, tilting cameras, or flipping mechanisms.

## !!steps Motors vs Servos

**Motors** spin around and around. They are great for wheels and arms that need to rotate continuously. You control them by setting a **power** level (-1 to 1).

**Servos** move to a specific angle and hold it. They are great for grippers, latches, and anything that needs to be in an exact position. You control them by setting a **position** (0 to 1).

Think of it this way:
- A motor is like a fan — it just spins.
- A servo is like a door — it opens to a specific angle and stays there.

## !!steps Find the Servo Block

In the Blocks editor, click on **Actuators** in the left menu, then click **Servo**.

Find the **set position** block — it looks like:

`set test_servo.Position to 0`

Drag this block into the **while loop** of your OpMode.

## !!steps Understanding Servo Position

Servo position is a number between **0** and **1**:

| Position Value | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **0** | All the way to one side |
| **0.5** | Middle position |
| **1** | All the way to the other side |

When you set a position, the servo moves there and **holds** — even if something tries to push it. That is what makes servos so useful for grippers and latches.

If the servo is already at the position you set, it will not move. That is normal!

## !!steps Set a Starting Position

It is a good idea to set your servo to a known position during **initialization** (the setup section before the main loop).

1. Drag a `set Position` block into the **initialization section** (above `waitForStart`)
2. Set the value to **0**

This way, every time your program starts, the servo resets to the same position before you press Play. No surprises!

## !!steps Control with Gamepad Buttons

Let us use gamepad buttons to toggle the servo between open and closed:

1. Add an **if/else** block inside the while loop
2. For the condition, use **gamepad1.A** (this is `true` when the A button is held)
3. **If A is pressed:** set servo position to **1** (open)
4. **Else:** set servo position to **0** (closed)

Now pressing A on your gamepad opens the servo, and releasing it closes it back. This is perfect for a simple claw!

## !!steps Test and Adjust

Save your OpMode and run it. Try these experiments:

1. **Change the positions** — try 0.3 and 0.7 instead of 0 and 1 for a smaller range of motion
2. **Use different buttons** — try gamepad1.B or gamepad1.X instead of A
3. **Add more servos** — if you have a second servo configured, add another set of position blocks

**Tip:** If your servo buzzes or jitters at a certain position, it might be hitting a physical limit. Try adjusting your position values slightly.
