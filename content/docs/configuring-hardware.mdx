Before you can program a motor or sensor, you have to tell the Control Hub what devices are connected and where. This is called **hardware configuration**.

## !!steps Why Configure?

The Control Hub has many ports, but it does not know what you plugged into each one. **Configuration** is like making a name tag for every device — you are telling the brain "a motor named `test_motor` is plugged into Port 0."

Without configuration, your Blocks code will not know which motor or sensor to talk to. You only need to do this once (unless you change your wiring).

## !!steps Open Configuration

On your Driver Hub (or Driver Station phone):

1. Tap the **three dots** menu in the top-right corner
2. Select **Configure Robot**
3. Tap **New** to create a new configuration
4. Select **Control Hub Portal** from the USB Devices list
5. Tap the **Control Hub** to start setting up devices

## !!steps Configure a Motor

1. Tap the **Motors** section
2. Find **Port 0** and tap the dropdown
3. Select your motor type — for example, **REV Robotics Core Hex Motor**
4. In the name field, type: `test_motor`
5. Tap **Done**

**Important:** Names are **case-sensitive**! `test_motor` and `Test_Motor` are treated as two different things. Keep names lowercase with underscores to avoid mistakes.

## !!steps Configure a Servo

1. Tap the **Servos** section
2. Find **Port 0** and tap the dropdown
3. Select **Servo**
4. In the name field, type: `test_servo`
5. Tap **Done**

If you are using a **continuous rotation servo** (one that spins all the way around), select **Continuous Rotation Servo** instead.

## !!steps Configure a Touch Sensor

1. Tap the **Digital Devices** section
2. Find **Port 1** and tap the dropdown (touch sensors must use odd-numbered ports: 1, 3, 5, or 7)
3. Select **REV Touch Sensor**
4. In the name field, type: `test_touch`
5. Tap **Done**

## !!steps Configure a Color Sensor

1. Tap the **I2C Bus 0** section
2. Tap **Add** to add a new device
3. Select **REV Color Sensor V3**
4. In the name field, type: `test_color`
5. Tap **Done**

Multiple I2C sensors can share the same bus as long as they have different addresses (the Color Sensor and Distance Sensor have different default addresses, so they work together).

## !!steps Save and Activate

1. Press **Done** until you are back at the USB Devices page
2. Tap **Save**
3. Give your configuration a name, like `myRobotConfig`
4. Tap **OK**, then tap **Back**

The Robot Controller will restart automatically. Your configuration is now **active** — the names you created (like `test_motor`) will appear as options in your Blocks code!
