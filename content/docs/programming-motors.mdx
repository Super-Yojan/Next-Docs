Now that your hardware is configured, it is time to make something move! In this tutorial, you will build a TwoMotorDrive program step by step using Blocks.

## !!steps Open Your OpMode

Open the Robot Controller Console (**192.168.43.1:8080**) in your browser and click the **Blocks** tab.

Find the OpMode you created earlier (like `TwoMotorDrive`) and click it to open the editor. If you have not created one yet, go back to the **Programming** tutorial first.

## !!steps Find the Motor Blocks

On the left side of the Blocks editor, click on **Actuators**, then click **DcMotor**. This opens a menu full of motor-related blocks.

You will need several blocks for setting up your motors:
- **set Mode** — tells the motor how to run (use `RUN_WITHOUT_ENCODER` for basic driving)
- **set Power** — controls how fast the motor spins (-1 to 1)
- **set Direction** — controls which way the motor spins

You can see all the available motor blocks listed in the sidebar.

## !!steps Initialize Your Motors

Drag motor blocks into the **initialization section** (above `waitForStart`) to set up both motors before the program starts.

For each motor (Left and Right), add a **set Mode** block and set it to `RUN_WITHOUT_ENCODER`. This is the simplest mode — you just set a power level and the motor spins.

Your initialization should look like:
- `set Left.Mode to RUN_WITHOUT_ENCODER`
- `set Right.Mode to RUN_WITHOUT_ENCODER`

## !!steps Create a Variable

To store the gamepad joystick values, you need to create **variables**. Click on **Variables** in the left sidebar, then click the **Create variable** button at the top.

Variables are like labeled boxes that hold a value. We will use them to store the joystick input before sending it to the motors.

## !!steps Name the Variable

A dialog will pop up asking for the variable name. Type `LeftActuation` and click **OK**.

This variable will hold the calculated power for the left motor based on gamepad input. You will create a second variable called `RightActuation` for the right motor using the same steps.

## !!steps See the Variable Blocks

After creating your variable, you will see new blocks appear in the **Variables** category:
- **set LeftActuation to** — stores a value in the variable
- **change LeftActuation by** — adds to the current value
- **LeftActuation** — a block that reads the current value

You will use the **set** block inside your main loop to store the joystick value each time the loop runs, and the **LeftActuation** block to send that value to the motor.

## !!steps Duplicate Blocks

Instead of rebuilding everything from scratch for the right motor, you can **duplicate** blocks. Right-click on a block (or long-press on a touchscreen) to see a context menu.

Click **Duplicate** to make a copy of the block. Then change the motor name from `Left` to `Right`. This saves a lot of time when setting up similar blocks for multiple motors.

## !!steps Add Gamepad Control

Now let us connect the gamepad joysticks to your motors. Inside the **main loop**, use `set LeftActuation to` and attach gamepad blocks.

Go to **Gamepad** in the block categories and drag out joystick blocks. For arcade-style driving, combine **LeftStickY** (forward/backward) with **RightStickX** (turning):
- `LeftActuation = gamepad2.LeftStickY - gamepad2.RightStickX`
- `RightActuation = gamepad2.LeftStickY + gamepad2.RightStickX`

Then set each motor's power using the variable multiplied by a speed factor (like 0.4 for 40% max speed).

## !!steps Final Code

Here is the complete TwoMotorDrive program. In the **initialization section**, both motors are set to `RUN_WITHOUT_ENCODER` mode. In the **main loop**:

1. Read the gamepad joystick values into `LeftActuation` and `RightActuation`
2. Multiply each by 0.4 to limit the speed
3. Set each motor's power to its corresponding actuation value

Save your OpMode and run it from the Driver Hub. Push the left stick forward to drive, and the right stick left/right to turn!
