Now that your hardware is configured, it is time to make something move! In this tutorial, you will learn how to control a motor using Blocks.

## !!steps Open Your OpMode

Open the Robot Controller Console (**192.168.43.1:8080**) in your browser and click the **Blocks** tab.

Find the OpMode you created earlier (like `MyFirstProgram`) and click it to open the editor. If you have not created one yet, go back to the **Programming** tutorial first.

## !!steps Find the Motor Block

On the left side of the Blocks editor, you will see categories of blocks. Click on **Actuators**, then click **DcMotor**.

This opens a menu full of motor-related blocks. The one you need is the **set power** block — it looks like:

`set test_motor.Power to 1`

Drag this block into your code and drop it inside the **while loop** (the repeating section of your program).

## !!steps Understanding Motor Power

Motor power is a number between **-1** and **1**:

| Power Value | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **1** | Full speed forward (100%) |
| **0.5** | Half speed forward (50%) |
| **0** | Stop |
| **-0.5** | Half speed backward (50%) |
| **-1** | Full speed backward (100%) |

Think of it like a volume dial — 1 is max volume, 0 is mute, and negative numbers play the music in reverse!

## !!steps Test Different Speeds

Try changing the power number and running your OpMode each time:

1. Set power to **1** — the motor spins at full speed
2. Set power to **0.3** — the motor spins slowly
3. Set power to **-1** — the motor spins the opposite direction
4. Set power to **0** — the motor stops

After each change, click **Save OpMode**, then run the program from your Driver Hub to see the result.

## !!steps Control with a Gamepad

Hardcoding a power number is not very useful for driving. Let us use the **gamepad joystick** instead!

1. Delete the number block attached to `set Power`
2. Go to **Gamepad** in the block categories
3. Drag out the **gamepad1.LeftStickY** block
4. Attach it to `set Power`

Now the motor speed is controlled by your left joystick. Push the stick forward for full power, pull it back for reverse, and center it to stop.

**Tip:** Connect your gamepad to the Driver Hub by pressing **Options + A** at the same time.

## !!steps Reverse the Direction

If pushing the joystick forward makes the motor spin the wrong way, you can flip the direction. The joystick gives **negative** values when pushed forward and **positive** when pulled back, which can feel backwards.

To fix it: wrap the gamepad value in a **negate** (minus) math block, or add a `set Direction` block before the loop and set it to **REVERSE**.

Save your OpMode and test again — now forward on the joystick should mean forward on the motor!
