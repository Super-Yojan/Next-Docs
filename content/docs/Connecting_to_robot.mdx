## !!steps Look for wifi name

Look for the wifi name that starts with "FTC-". 

To ensure you are able to locate the correct device, it is recommended that you first connect in a location without other active Control Hubs or significant Wi-Fi connections.


Depending on your version of Windows or other theme settings your Wi-Fi Networks list may vary in appearance.
